# lookhere-romans

### This is a project for a class: Museums and Interactive Technologies [NYU, Spring 2019]

We worked together with **Sondra Phifer**, a student from the class to create 'Look Here'.

#### This is her description of her idea for the application: 

Every museum wrestles with the question of how can they share enough information about their objects with their visitors. On one hand, curators choose a selective group of works for display. These objects tend to have long descriptive gallery labels, filled with curator jargon and loan/provenance identifiers. This information is wonderful for specialists, but often off-putting or overwhelming to students and novices. At the other hand, there are many objects with bare labels, sometimes with only a title and accession number. Many historic artworks barely receive a glimpse because visitors simply don’t know what they are looking at. Museums have been relying on instructors, docents, and online collections to bridge the informational gap.   
 
What if museums and educators collaborated to have students from higher education fill this gap?  Using the museum’s collection to produce a crowdsourced app, students will get a hands-on experience of learning how to examine an object and demonstrate excellent research and critical thinking skills. The museum could offer 3D files of their artifacts on their website and educators (or the students) could download the 3D file to conduct research on these objects. The main objective of this application is to make our students better critical thinkers and self-efficient ask their own questions (example: why did the artist choose to represent this figure, why did the artisan use this myth on this container. 
 
The student will extrapolate information about the significant ‘points’ of the object, such as the decoration, function, and medium. Each ‘point’ will correspond to a hotspot on the 3D object. The completed researched ‘points’ will be added to the 3D file and then uploaded to an A/R app to be used in the museum. This collaboration flips the classroom, so that students will learn how to examine an object and then conduct their own research. In addition, the finished app can be shared with museum visitors so that they may learn about certain objects while at the museum, without having to rely on the availability of museum educators.
 
For this project, we will start with a template using the ancient Roman objects from the Metropolitan Museum. To introduce our users to the time period, we will provide a home page with 3 or 4 fictional figures, each corresponding to a certain social class, to guide the user through the galleries (another teachable moment: we can show how an object’s artistry/media varied, based on a person’s economic status). When they are in the gallery, the user selects one figure. Using A/R and geocache, location markers will appear above 3-4 real life objects in the gallery; this figure would have ‘owned’ these objects. The user then goes to one of the objects and looks through their phone to see glowing hotspots or ‘points’ on the artifact. The user will touch each ‘point’ on their phone to learn why this area on the object is important (ie: iconography, design, function). Hopefully, this instructional app will inspire instructors to incorporate this technology in their flipped classrooms and guide visitors on how to look at object and promote critical thinking.
